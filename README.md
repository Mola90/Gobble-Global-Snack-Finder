## Description
This group project has been completed as a part of the Adelaide University Web Development bootcamp. Four members in total completed this project including:

The challenge for this assignment was to create our first fullstack application from the ground up as a group. Ultimately what we ended up creating is a website where users from around the world can post their favourite Snacks(whether that be chocolates, chips, drinks or lollies) for other users to discover and see. This way when another user intends to travel to a unique country or continent they will have an idea what unique snacks they have to try when they go to a supermarket in another country.

You can access a deployed version of this application here:
